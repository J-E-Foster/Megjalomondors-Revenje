## How to run a program via IDLE

We need an [**IDE**](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide) to make programming easier. Python comes with its own one, **IDLE**:

* Search for the folder where you saved **capstone_2.py** (or any other Python file).
* **Make sure all the game images and font located in the "Game-images" folder are copied to the same folder**.
* Right click on the icon, and choose **"Edit with IDLE"**:

![](IDLE-run-images-cap2/0.jpg)

* The file should open. Click the **"Run"** tab and **"Run Module"**:

![](IDLE-run-images-cap2/1.jpg)

* You should now see game running in the **IDLE** console:

And that's it - you're good to go!
