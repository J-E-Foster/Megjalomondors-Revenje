This project is a simple horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up style game made using Pygame, entitled Megjalomondor's Revenje. The current version is a shortened one-level demo that is meant to be expanded into a more playable game, and/or serve as reference or template code. 

## How does it work?

Install Python and Pygame, run program, and play. 
* The user presses arrow keys for up, down, left, right, and space for shoot. 
* Enemy and prize objects move across the screen from the right.
* Player starts with 3 lives. Lives are lost when touching emeny objects. If lives = 0, game over.    	-Points are gained by shooting enemies. 
* Lives are gained by touching reward objects. 
* If points = 5, the stage boss appears, and 5 shots win the game. 
* The user can play again or quit.

## Who can use it? 

This open source, free software is free to play or modify by anyone. It will especially benefit those who are just starting out studying Python/Pygame, and need a simple example illustrating movements and collisions.

Anyone  who would like to help improve the game is more than welcome to contribute!
